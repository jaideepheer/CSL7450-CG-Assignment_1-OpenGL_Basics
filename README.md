## Development/Compiling

### Native
The project requires the following apt-get libraries.
- `freeglut3-dev`
- [`meson`](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html)
- `mingw64` to cross compile for windows-64bit.
And all their dependencies.

It is recommended to use the docker image provided for compiling the code.

### VSCode
- Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) is installed on your system.
- **[Optional]** If you plan to use WSL2 for Docker for Windows then make sure [GWSL](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NL6KD1H33V3) is installed and is running, to run WSL2 GUI apps in windows.
- Clone this repo and open in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- In VSCode press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `Reopen in Container` to open folder in container.
- In VSCode open a new terminal and run `meson setup builddir`.
- Development environment is now ready.
- Make sure both `asabil.meson` and `mrmomo.meson-build` extensions are installed in VSCode.
- To compile press `Ctrl+Shift+P` > `Run Tasks` > `Meson` > `Compile Q1`(or any Q. you like).
- To run press `Ctrl+Shift+P` > `Run Tasks` > `Meson` > `Run Q1`(or any Q. you like).

To compile code for all platforms run `bash ./compile_all.sh` in the working directory.

To manually compile run `meson setup builddir` in root of project. Then run `cd builddir`, then run `ninja`. The compiled files will be under `builddir/src` folder.

### Docker
The dev environment docker image can be found at [this page](https://github.com/users/jaideepheer/packages/container/package/csl7450-cg-assignment_1-opengl_basics%2Fdevenv).
